                            It's going to be two, very intense years of training and learning
                            how to become a part of this fast growing industry of tech, webdeveloping
                            and IT, for which I'm super excited about.
                            In September 2023 I will start my internship which will last until
                            May 2024. If you feel that I could be an asset to your particular
                            company, I would be more than happy to hear from you and continue
                            to develop my skills during my internship.

                        <h3>Creativity</h3>
                        <p>I love creativity in all shapes and forms. Leather craft is something I've been doing for a
                            couple of years now. Making wallets, handbags and other small things. It's very therapeutic for
                            me. Knitting, sewing, painting and crafting is also consuming my free time.</p>
